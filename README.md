This project addressed the challenge of identifying ALS patients within the insured population of the israeli healthcare system. This was achieved through the analysis of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data that change over time, focusing on laboratory test indicators collected over several years. The project involved conducting experiments to determine the most pertinent time intervals for training a classification model and extracting insights during the data exploration and processing stages to facilitate model training. While opting for a non-temporal model, we acknowledged the importance of time dynamics in this context. Consequently, we devised a method to derive temporal behavior representations from medical records and incorporated them into the model as flat features.

* The repository lacks data, and the Python files were not included due to the sensitive medical information of the patients
