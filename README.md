This project dealt with the problem of classification of ALS patients from among the population of the insured of the health system in Israel. This, with the help of the analysis of the medical record (EHR) data of the insured while focusing on the indicators collected in laboratory tests over the years. In the project, we performed an experiment to find the most relevant time ranges for training a classification model and generated insights from the stages of data research and processing.
for the purpose of training the model. We chose to use a non-temporal model, but while giving expression to the time dimension, which is significant in this problem. To this end, we decided to generate from the medical records moments that would express the behavior of the features over time, and then enter them into the model as flat features.

* To - the data and the python files were not attached due to the sensitive medical information of the patients
